# Calendar Events Bot

This bot helps you manage and process calendar events from an ICS file and outputs them into an Excel spreadsheet.

## Overview

The bot takes an ICS file (a common format for calendar data) and converts the events into an Excel file named `calendar_events.xlsx`. If the output file already exists, it will be deleted and regenerated.

## Software

To run this bot, you need the following software:

1. **Python**: Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Code Editor**: You will need a code editor to edit the `main.py` file. Recommended options include:
   - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
   - [Atom](https://atom.io/)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Bot

1. Download the ZIP file from the GitHub repository.
2. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Environment

1. **Install a Code Editor**: If you donâ€™t have a code editor, you can download one
   
2. **Install Required Packages**: 
   - Open your terminal (Command Prompt for Windows, Terminal for macOS).
   - Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files.
   - Install the necessary packages by running the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

### Step 3: Prepare Your ICS File

1. Locate your ICS file.
2. Open the `main.py` file in your code editor.
3. Find the line where `ics_file` is defined, and insert the path to your ICS file:
   ```python
   ics_file = 'path/to/your/file.ics'


### Step 3: Run the bot
For macOS, use the following command in your terminal:
    ```python
    python3 main.py 

For Windows, use this command:
    ```python
    python main.py


### Output
After running the bot, you will find a new file named calendar_events.xlsx in the same directory. This file contains all the events from your ICS file formatted for easy viewing.

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter any errors, ensure that you have installed all the required packages and that the path to your ICS file is correct.
